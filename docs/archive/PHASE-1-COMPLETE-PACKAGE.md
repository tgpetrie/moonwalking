## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### DON'T:
❌ Add more features before launching
❌ Build perfect UI before getting users
❌ Integrate OpenBB before validating demand
❌ Create accounts system before needed
❌ Build mobile app before web is proven
❌ Spend weeks on analytics dashboard

### DO:
✅ Ship working features fast
✅ Get real user feedback
✅ Iterate based on actual usage
✅ Focus on revenue-generating features
✅ Keep stack simple
✅ Add complexity only when needed

**Remember**: Perfect is the enemy of done.

## 📱 Mobile Strategy

### Phase 1: Mobile-Responsive Web
```
✅ Works on any device
✅ No app store approval
✅ Instant updates
✅ One codebase
✅ Ships in days
```

### Phase 2: Progressive Web App (PWA)
```
✅ Add to home screen
✅ Push notifications
✅ Offline mode
✅ Still web-based
✅ Still no app stores
```

### Phase 3: Native App (IF needed)
```
Only if:
- Users explicitly request it

```
