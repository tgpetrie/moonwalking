### ONE BOARD GRID (excerpt)

```text
1. There is one board grid: `.bh-board` + `.bh-board-row-*` + `.bh-board-panel`.
2. There is one row grid: `.bh-row`.
3. All rows (1m, 3m, watchlist) derive from `TokenRow` (or `AnimatedTokenRow`).
4. Banners use `BannerTicker` and live in `bh-board-row-full`.
5. Bunny layer is low opacity, scrolls with the board, affected by hover, never affects layout.
6. Any divergence from these classes or structures is a bug.
```
4:- Keep layout rails stable and predictable. Do not change `.bh-row`, `.bh-board-row-*`, or the 1m two-mode layout without approval.
