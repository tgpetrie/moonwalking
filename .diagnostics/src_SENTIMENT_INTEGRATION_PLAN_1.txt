# Sentiment System Integration Plan

## Current State Analysis

### System 1: Enhanced Aggregator (NEW - Just Added)
**File:** `backend/sentiment_aggregator_enhanced.py`
- ✅ Coin-specific data (BTC vs ETH get different results)
- ✅ Fear & Greed Index
- ✅ CoinGecko per-coin metrics
- ✅ Reddit mentions per coin
- ✅ Simple caching
- ✅ Deterministic fallbacks
- ❌ Limited to 3 sources
- ❌ No VADER sentiment analysis
- ❌ No RSS feeds
- ❌ No tier system

### System 2: Comprehensive Multi-Source (OLD - Fully Featured)
**Files:** `sentiment_data_sources.py`, `sentiment_api_full.py`
- ✅ VADER sentiment analysis with crypto lexicon
- ✅ Multiple RSS feeds (CoinDesk, CryptoSlate, Bitcoin Magazine, etc.)
- ✅ Reddit integration with 5+ subreddits
- ✅ Tier-based weighting (Tier 1: 0.85, Tier 2: 0.70, Tier 3: 0.50)
- ✅ Comprehensive configuration (sentiment_config.yaml)
- ✅ Divergence detection
- ✅ Trending topics extraction
- ✅ 50+ data sources capability
- ❌ Returns same sentiment for all coins
- ❌ Not integrated with current Flask app
- ❌ Uses FastAPI (different framework)

## Integration Strategy

### Approach: Hybrid Best-of-Both

Combine the coin-specific approach from System 1 with the comprehensive multi-source collection from System 2.

**Result:**
- Each coin gets unique sentiment based on coin-specific sources
- Market-wide sources (Fear & Greed, RSS feeds) shared across all coins
- VADER sentiment analysis on all text
- 50+ data sources capability
- Tier-based weighting
- Integrated into existing Flask app

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Merge Data Sources (High Priority)
**Goal:** Create unified sentiment collector with both coin-specific and market-wide sources

**Tasks:**
1. Merge `sentiment_data_sources.py` into `backend/sentiment_aggregator_enhanced.py`
2. Add VADER sentiment analysis to all text processing
3. Add RSS feed collectors (CoinDesk, CryptoSlate, etc.)
4. Add Reddit collector with multiple subreddits
5. Implement tier-based weighting system
6. Add divergence detection

**Output:** `backend/sentiment_aggregator_unified.py`
