# Cursor Rules

- Always read `docs/ai/AI_INDEX.md` first (ground truth).
- Obey `ai.manifest.json` for ports, entry, and events.
- Frontend must mount `<Dashboard />` from `frontend/src/main.jsx`.
- Do not add or suggest loader/token demo screens.
- Write resilient code: guard arrays, validate numbers, abort long fetches.
